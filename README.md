# Guess-the-number-Game
  “Guess the Number” is a simple game developed in C where the computer generates a random number within a given range (for example, 1 to 100), and the player tries to guess it.  The program takes the user’s input and checks whether the guessed number is too high, too low, or correct. It  gives hints until the player guesses the correct number.
